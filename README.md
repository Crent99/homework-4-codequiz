UNC at Chapel Hill Bootcamp Homework 4: Code Quiz

Decsription: This webpage is a quiz on coding that used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There's a total of 5 questions in this quiz with a 60 second time limit, if you get a question wrong then 15 seconds is taken off. At the end of the quiz is a highscore page that you can tally your highscore and show off what you got. You can use your initals in the submit form or any other name you wish to go by. You can also clear the highscores and return to the original page to start all over and try to get a better score. Anyway if you give it a try... goodluck!!!
